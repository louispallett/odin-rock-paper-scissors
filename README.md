The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Project

Part of The Odin Project Foundations course. Create a game of "rock, paper, scissors". Played entirely in the console.

26.02.23 - Prompted user to give result (ensuring this is not case sensitive) and directed the computer to give a random choice of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

26.02.23 (22:30) - Added play round function. Cleaned up code created early to ensure the round works (redefining variables so not using functions as parameters).

26.02.23 (23:54) - Added loop to play 5 times.
